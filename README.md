### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a Front-End Developer

### ðŸŒŸ My Approach

I'm not just obsessed with writing **clear and clean code**. I care that what's being done **makes sense**: for the user, for the development team, and for the business. **Their experiences matter to me.**

It's not that I'm "the most technical person in the world." But I know how to **communicate clearly**, I **think before I write**, and I care that what I deliver **works well**.

ðŸ’¡ That's why three things are often highlighted about me: my **soft skills**, my **analytical ability**, and my **commitment to quality**. And yes, I take that as a compliment.
